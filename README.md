# `Goal`


# `Process`


# `CAD`
We had made a planning papper before starting to outline the design we wanted. This made the process a lot easier, as I didn't have to make it up as I went. The basic design was pretty simple at first, two supports and an arm. It's always the details that are problematic, though. One such detail is how we have the arm spin. The original plan was to have a ball bearing in the arm and a rod through the supports and arms. It turned out the bearing was too big, and also unnecessary for this small of a design. We went instead for a bushing design, where there is a static rod connected that the arm spins around, no bearing needed.
Another rude awakening came when I remembered that we like need an arduino, screen, and rotary encoder, ya know, to do the pid'ing. So I had to make space for those 

# `Code`
The code was challenging overall, but once the main hurdle was cleared (finding good PID code online), it strted to get easier. The first problem was that both the gyroscope and the LCD screen required SDA and SCL pins, and the Metro M4 only had one of each.
